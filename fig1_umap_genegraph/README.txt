readme for fig 1

make the rds containing moz stage data plus asexuals from reid et al. from the counts and coldata files. These data were used to id variable features and prep data for gene graph in genegraph_withlifeasexsubook_20200625.

Gene graph was then made using submca.qc.elifeasex.subook.featslxn_gene_clustering_K1520_202000625.ipynb (sorry for horrible file name)

coordinates and clusters read into gene graph notebook to make graph and heatmap figs in R

UMAP and cell cluster viz figs made using umap.elifeasexsubook_20200626
